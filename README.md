# Budget Web App

## Features
- import bank accounts and transactions
- manually add transactions
- categorise transactions
- custom spending categories
- overview of expenses, income and balance
- filtering
- set up budget and limits
- add custom labels on imported transactions
- auth (email + password)

## Why?
I have not yet found a budgetting app which allows both automatic retrieval of 
transactions for my bank and customisation of spending categories. I do not want
to manually type transactions and I want to create speding categories that fit 
with my lifestyle.  

## How?
I am building this app using Python, stack TBC.

The app will retrieve banking transactions via the Nordigen API to provide automated tracking and customizable spending categories.
