# Budget Web App

## What?
Web app which shows transactions on chosen bank accounts and presents insights
on spending categories and budget.

## Why?
I have not yet found a budgetting app which allows both automatic retrieval of 
transactions for my bank and customisation of spending categories. I do not want
to manually type transactions and I want to create speding categories that fit 
with my lifestyle.  

## How?
I am building this app using TypeScript and React with the following stack:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **API Integration**: Axios for banking API communication
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Vercel

The app will retrieve banking transactions via the Nordigen API to provide automated tracking and customizable spending categories.
