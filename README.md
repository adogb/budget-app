# Budget Web App
Work in progres...

## What?
Web app which shows transactions on chosen bank accounts and presents insights
on spending categories and budget.

## Why?
I have not yet found a budgetting app which allows both automatic retrieval of 
transactions for my bank and customisation of spending categories. I do not want
to manually type transactions and I want to create speding categories that fit 
with my lifestyle.  

## How?
I intend to write the app in Python and Flask, and retrieve banking transactions
via the Nordigen API. I'll be learning Flask and increase my knowledge of how to 
use APIs with Python.
